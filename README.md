Welcome to the "Digit Recognizer using Support Vector Machine (SVM)" project. In this project, we've developed a digit recognition system using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Our model achieves a high accuracy of 97% on the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

Digit recognition is a fundamental problem in machine learning and computer vision. This project focuses on accurately classifying hand-written digits (0 to 9) based on image data. We utilized Scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library, to implement and train the SVM classifier for this purpose.

Key project highlights:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- SVM model training and hyperparameter tuning.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics.
- Documentation and reporting of results.

## Accuracy

Our SVM-based digit recognition system achieved an impressive accuracy of 97% on the MNIST dataset. This accuracy is measured by the proportion of correctly classified digits and reflects the model's robustness.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the MNIST dataset used for training and testing.
- `digit_recognizer_svm.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license information.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook and explore the code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn (0.24)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-recognizer-svm.git
   cd digit-recognizer-svm
   ```

2. Open and run the `digit_recognizer_svm.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to explore the complete project workflow and view the results.

3. Customize the code, experiment with different hyperparameters, or try the model with new datasets to further improve the accuracy.
